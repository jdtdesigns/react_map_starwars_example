# React Map Activity One - Day 3

In this activity, you'll use the array map method to loop over an array of names and generate an ```<li>``` for each name in the array.

## Instructions

* Within your App component, create an array of names, using a static const variable
* Using the array .map() method, loop over the names array and output an ```<li>``` within the provided ```<ul>``` for each name in the array.
  * Don't forget the ```key``` prop that is required on each item returned from the .map() callback

### Hints
* If you get stuck, check out [this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) on working with lists in React.  **Only do this if you exhaust all other methods of research!**
