# React Counter Activity - Day 3

In this activity, you'll import useState to create a count variable and pass the setter function to the Header to update the count

## Instructions

* Import useState from react
* Using array deconstruction, create a state variable called ```count``` and a setter function called ```setCount```
* Pass the setCount function to the Header and use the two provided buttons to update the count appropriately on click
* Output the count variable in the provided h1 within main

### Bonus
* See if you can set the decrease button to only decrease count if the count is greater than zero.

### Hints
* If you get stuck, check out [this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/hooks-state.html) on useState.  **Only do this if you exhaust all other methods of research!**
