# React Map Activity Two - Day 3

In this activity, you'll use the array map method to loop over an array of Starwars characters provided in the data.json file, and generate a ```<div>``` for each object in the array.

## Instructions

* Import the data.json array into your App component file. 
* Using the array .map() method, loop over the characters array and output a ```<div>``` for each character object in the array.
  * The div should have the following two internal elements:
    * An ```<h3>``` with the character's name.
    * A ```<p>``` with the character's birth year.
  * Don't forget the ```key``` prop that is required on each item returned from the .map() callback

### Hints
* If you get stuck, check out [this guide](https://reactjs.org/docs/lists-and-keys.html) on working with lists in React.  **Only do this if you exhaust all other methods of research!**
